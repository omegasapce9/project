    <h1>Animal Adoption Drives</h1>
    <p>Animals that tend to have stronger social groups, including humans, seem to be more likely to “adopt” orphaned or rejected young. These can include troops of apes and primates, pods of dolphins or whales, elephant herds, wolf packs, bird nests and other tight-knit animal groups, as well as domesticated animals. It’s rarer for solitary-type animals to adopt. These would include wild cats, bears, rhinos, koalas, etc</p>

After falling in love in mid-life, Kris and the outdoorsman and entrepreneur Doug Tompkins left behind the world of the massively successful outdoor brands they'd helped pioneer -- Patagonia, The North Face, and Esprit -- and turned their attention to a visionary effort to create National Parks throughout Chile and Argentina. WILD LIFE chronicles the highs and lows of their journey to effect the largest private land donation in history</p>
